# streamlit-app-Diagnosis-of-COVID-19
This repository is created for generating a streamlit app for my Data Science project named "Diagnosis of COVID-19 and its clinical spectrum"

### **Tools used**
- Google Colab: for drawing the schema of my analysis and for consuming its server ressources (RAM & Memory)
- Pycharm: to create the ".py" final files and the streamlit app files
- Github: to push the streamlit app code on a repository
- share.streamlit.io : to deploy my streamlit app for free

### **About Dataset**
For this project, I have used "Diagnosis of COVID-19 and its clinical spectrum" dataset on kaggle. This dataset is big and contains many informations ab

#### **Background**
The World Health Organization (WHO) characterized the COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2, as a pandemic on March 11, while the exponential increase in the number of cases was risking to overwhelm health systems around the world with a demand for ICU beds far above the existing capacity, with regions of Italy being prominent examples.

Brazil recorded the first case of SARS-CoV-2 on February 26, and the virus transmission evolved from imported cases only, to local and finally community transmission very rapidly, with the federal government declaring nationwide community transmission on March 20.

Until March 27, the state of S達o Paulo had recorded 1,223 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with 68 related deaths, while the county of S達o Paulo, with a population of approximately 12 million people and where Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein is located, had 477 confirmed cases and 30 associated death, as of March 23. Both the state and the county of S達o Paulo decided to establish quarantine and social distancing measures, that will be enforced at least until early April, in an effort to slow the virus spread.

One of the motivations for this challenge is the fact that in the context of an overwhelmed health system with the possible limitation to perform tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, testing every case would be impractical and tests results could be delayed even if only a target subpopulation would be tested.

#### **The Dataset**
This dataset contains anonymized data from patients seen at the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, at S達o Paulo, Brazil, and who had samples collected to perform the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and additional laboratory tests during a visit to the hospital.

All data were anonymized following the best international practices and recommendations. All clinical data were standardized to have a mean of zero and a unit standard deviation.

#### **Task Details**
###### **TASK 1 : Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
I'll begin with a background analysis and finish with a shape analysis
